</br>
The application allows users to sign up and create an account. On the home page, users will see a feed of all users thoughts with the username, creation date, time and the number of reactions. If logged in, a form to create a thought will conditionally render at the top, along with the user's friend list to the right of the page. On the me page, a feed of the logged in user's thoughts will appear, along with the friend list to the right, and a form to create a thought at the bottom. User's can view other user's profiles, see their friend list and add them as a friend.
